# Mission-to-Mars

The data Robin has gathered for her web app is great. She's been able to pull a great image, the most recent news article summary, and even an HTML table. Each data type is different, though, with text and images and HTML all together. Compared to SQL's orderly relational system, where each table is linked to at least one other by a key, the data we've helped Robin gather is a bit chaotic. This is where a non-relational database comes in.
